My interests are focused on real-time vision systems for autonomous robots. In my research, I use heterogeneous computing platforms and high-level environments enabling the modelling of algorithms and designed systems. My research also concerns the use of neuromorphic event sensors in modern vision data processing systems that require the development of new data processing methods.
