## Short Bio

I design low-power, real-time vision systems for autonomous vehicles and robotics. My research centers on event-based (neuromorphic) cameras and graph neural networks, with an emphasis on turning these ideas into deployable hardware on FPGAs and SoC platforms. I’m especially interested in efficient, low-latency AI pipelines and sensor-fusion methods that make perception faster, and more reliable in the real world.
