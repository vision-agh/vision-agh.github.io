        I design low-power, real-time vision systems for autonomous vehicles and robotics.
        My research centers on event-based (neuromorphic) cameras and graph neural networks,
        with an emphasis on turning these ideas into deployable hardware on FPGAs and SoC platforms.
        I’m especially interested in efficient, low-latency AI pipelines and sensor-fusion methods
        that make perception faster and more reliable in the real world.
