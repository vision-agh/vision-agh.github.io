## Short Bio

I focus on hardware acceleration for computer vision systems, with particular interest in event-based (neuromorphic) vision and deep neural network solutions. My work covers algorithm design tailored to the target platform, as well as the implementation and verification of hardware modules on reconfigurable FPGA platforms.
